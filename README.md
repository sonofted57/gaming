This is a controller configuration to use the PS3 Six Axis Dualshock 3 with Nintendont.
It will only work on homebrewed Wii.

Itâ€™s main purpose is to give (in my opinion) better controls for:
Resident Evil,
Resident Evil 2,
Resident Evil Code: Veronica X,
and
Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes

All you need to do is paste the controller.ini file into the route of your USB device.
